##3-D images Database for Capsule Neural Networks.
##Objective:
The objective of the Project is to Create a Database of images of 3-D object’s and create a website, so it can be used by capsule neural networks team and Data base can be made available to public.
To achieve this the project is divided into Tasks where each Task contributes to final goal.
1.Create images of 3-D objects using Maya.
2.Create a Database schema
3.cloud integration.
4.website creation.
We are assigned the task to generate images using Maya. The workflow of the project is now described in a weekly manner.
###Week 1: 
In week 1 we are assigned with a task to explore Maya and get familiar with python and Mel scripting.
 Results from Week 1:
1.watched videos to get familiar with Maya.
2. explored Maya and learned how to input commands using python scripting.
3.created basic objects like sphere’s and cubes using Python script.
As I got familiar with Maya I was assigned the task to generate images of objects at various angles .
###week 2:
I explored various options to write a script where I can generate images of objects.
One trial gave me the below result.
![First Try](https://github.com/nikunjlad/3D-Object-Classification-Using-Capsule-Networks/blob/kaushik/Maya3D-Images-Dataset/kaushik/trex.png)
-The above image is generated by creating a circle around the object and appending a camera to it.
-As the circles rotates around the object the camera renders the image of the object at that position.
After presenting this to project team mates there were many corrections incorporated as we need to create images where we can have a shadow of the image that resembles to real world image.
##conclusions from week 1:
-A generalized environment for entire project is proposed as all the images should align.
-A standard color for the objects is used as objects included multiple colors.
###Week 3:
I was assigned the task to gather objects and to generate images.
I gathered 21 objects that belonged to animal category.

Used to generate images in various environments to see which yields a result that satisfies the project requirement.
Multiple environments are used in this stage.
1.sphere environment 
2.box environment.
3.cube environment.
In the above environments the following problems were noticed:
1.noise
2.gradients 
3.shadows.
We narrowed it to using an environment where a white plane is used behind the object and directional lights are used to generate the shadow of the object.
