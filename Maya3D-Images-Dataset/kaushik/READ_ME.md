## 3-D images Database for Capsule Neural Networks.

## Objective: 
The objective of the Project is to Create a Database of images of 3-D object’s and create a website, so it can be used by capsule neural networks team and Data base can be made available to public.
To achieve this the project is divided into Tasks where each Task contributes to final goal.
1. Create images of 3-D objects using Maya.
2. Create a Database schema
3. cloud integration.
4. website creation.
We are assigned the task to generate images using Maya. The workflow of the project is now described in a weekly manner.

### Week 1: 
In week 1 we are assigned with a task to explore Maya and get familiar with python and Mel scripting.
Results from Week 1:
1. watched videos to get familiar with Maya.
2. explored Maya and learned how to input commands using python scripting.
3. created basic objects like sphere’s and cubes using Python script.
As I got familiar with Maya I was assigned the task to generate images of objects at various angles .
### week 2:
I explored various options to write a script where I can generate images of objects.
One trial gave me the below result.
![First Try](https://github.com/nikunjlad/3D-Object-Classification-Using-Capsule-Networks/blob/kaushik/Maya3D-Images-Dataset/kaushik/trex.png)
* The above image is generated by creating a circle around the object and appending a camera to it.
* As the circles rotates around the object the camera renders the image of the object at that position.
* After presenting this to project team mates there were many corrections incorporated as we need to create images where we can have a shadow of the image that resembles to real world image.
so from this I was expected to come with the below mentioned changes:
* A generalized environment for entire project is proposed as all the images should align.
* A standard color for the objects is used as objects included multiple colors.
### Week 3:
* I was assigned the task to gather objects and to generate images.
* I gathered 21 objects that belonged to animal category.

Used to generate images in various environments to see which yields a result that satisfies the project requirement.
Multiple environments are used in this stage.
* 1.sphere environment 
* 2.box environment.
* 3.cube environment.
In the above environments the following problems were noticed:
* noise
* gradients 
* shadows.
We narrowed it to using an environment where a white plane is used behind the object and directional lights are used to generate the shadow of the object.
![final environment](https://github.com/nikunjlad/3D-Object-Classification-Using-Capsule-Networks/blob/kaushik/Maya3D-Images-Dataset/kaushik/environment.PNG)
* The finalized environment looks like this where we put a white image in the background, a plane and lights for shadows.
* This environment contains circle where light, camera is appended to it.
* So as the circle rotates around the object the camera takes pictures of the object at that position.
* The objects created using this environment looks like this:

I need to incorporate many changes in my images as my images didn’t align with the project requirement.

* Initially objects were like this, I need to work on my objects to create a smooth object.
* So, I incorporated these changes to all my objects and finally achieved smooth objects.
![smooth object](https://github.com/nikunjlad/3D-Object-Classification-Using-Capsule-Networks/blob/kaushik/Maya3D-Images-Dataset/kaushik/smooth%20object.png)
The script used in this environment is a finalized script by the project team members.
The notable mentions in the final script is the naming convention as this plays a major role in the database.
Category_sub category_object name_X(angle)_y(angle)_Z(angle)_Yes_shader_Background.

This naming convention explains the category of the object (ex: animal)
* The sub category of the object. (ex: dog)
* The name of the object. (ex: bull dog)
* X Y Z determines the angle of the image which was rendered.
* YES/NO says with shadow or without shadow.
* Shader is telling about the object color WHITE/BLACK.
* Background_color is about BLACK/white.
### Week 4:
* I am assigned to finalize the dataset we have. 
* Implemented major changes to my dataset by incorporating more details in my objects and getting them in align with all the images.
* Worked on images created by rest of the project members as different tasks were assigned to them.
* Worked to create in different environment where we change the background to black and object to white color.
![black background](https://github.com/nikunjlad/3D-Object-Classification-Using-Capsule-Networks/blob/kaushik/Maya3D-Images-Dataset/kaushik/black%20bckgrnd.PNG)
The environment looks like this. The only change we made here changing the white image plane to black which create a different background and changed the image color to white.
it is not possible to get shadows using this environment
The image rendered using above environment will look like this:
![black background image](https://github.com/nikunjlad/3D-Object-Classification-Using-Capsule-Networks/blob/kaushik/Maya3D-Images-Dataset/kaushik/shire%20horse_X120_Y240_Z240_No.png)
* I implemented these changes to 30 images approximately.
* Created images of all the objects without shadows too.
* By doing all the above-mentioned tasks I made sure that every image is in par and created a consistent dataset that can be used by capsule neural networks team.
* the script used for generating image sequence:
[script](https://github.com/nikunjlad/3D-Object-Classification-Using-Capsule-Networks/blob/kaushik/Maya3D-Images-Dataset/kaushik/script.py)

*the database created using the dataset is :
