# Describing What my work in this project is:-

## Tasks:-
  * Learning Maya environment and scripting
  * Learning to Translate , rotate, scale and other other things in Maya
  * Writing a script which rotates and takes pictures
  * Creating an environment which has no gradients
  * Creating an environment which provides shadows
  * Creating a website

## WEEK 1 :-
  In week 1 , we were given the task of learning and getting familar with Maya environment and how to script in python / mel
  #### Things I explored:
       • Script to reset environment
       • Script to translate and rotate an object
       • Animate a camera and smoothen its path using graphs
  
## Week 2 :-
  In week 2, I had to come up with a script which rotate an object and takes pictues and stores them in a folder
  
##### The initial images look like below

> In the above gif , the object is being rotated around its pivot and I was to rotate a camera around the object to make it look more natural.
  
After initial presentation to the project team, and as per the requirement I was asked to create an environment which supports shadows
  
Thus resulting a need to create a new environment with lights.

## Week 3 :-
 In week 3, my job was to create a environment with shadows and no gradients, I came up with an environment shown below

 But the problem was that it had gradients which causes noise, thus resulting in a new environment
 
 #### Plain environmet and static shadows
