# 3D-Object-Image-Generation-For-Capsule-Networks
## My contribution in short

### Week 1
- Installed Maya on Day 1
- Explored Maya and learnt its functionality using tutorials given by Prof Nik Brown and Youtube [tutorials](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCn_SncP23QP819Y__Ew7VIA).
- Built basic objects like cubes, cones , etc
- Rotated them using python scripting
- Created camera and lights to get understanding of how shadows work
- Tried to manually capture images from camera view on single axis

### Week 2
- Started to work on the developing the scripts
- Worked on understanding the scripts developed by other teammates
- Fine tuned the parameters of "[Snapshot Script](https://github.com/nikunjlad/3D-Object-Classification-Using-Capsule-Networks/blob/smit/Maya3D-Images-Dataset/Smit/Snapshot_Script.py)" to get good quality images
- The problems we faced was quality of images and the noise that came with taking snapshots
- We figured it out that by getting render image- we can maintain the quality of images.
- The image we obtained looked like following:

### Week 3
- We needed shadows - so , we had to create a new [environment](https://github.com/nikunjlad/3D-Object-Classification-Using-Capsule-Networks/blob/smit/Maya3D-Images-Dataset/Smit/BestScene.mb).
- The above environment consists of a camera, lights, plane and final [script](https://github.com/nikunjlad/3D-Object-Classification-Using-Capsule-Networks/blob/smit/Maya3D-Images-Dataset/Smit/Final_Script.py)
- This script rotates the camera by 45 degrees on each axis, it generates 540 images per object with shadows.
- While few of us were working on improving the environment and finalizing the best script , I was collecting the objects
- Collecting objects seems like downloading stuff from internet, but it isn't as easy as it looks; takes too much time to get relevant objects.
- I managed to collect 42 objects and developed major categories of electronics and food.

### Week 4
- The object which were collected came in all shapes,colors and sizes - which were exactly not suitable to our environment
- We developed a practice of importing the objects, merging all the meshes , rescaling , applying shaders and making them point towards the person on laptop before actually importing it to our environment.

- Optimizing it before actually getting to run script on it consumed much time
- Images after optimization looked like:

- Images generated after running the script looked like:

### Week 5
- Cumulatively, we collected almost 200 objects together and built different categories.
- While, few of us moved to working on database and website, i still continued dealing with objects and image generation.
- Four of us  took the task of checking all the images generated by others and making corrections wherever required.
- Handling so many images and naming all of them was becoming difficult time to time
- We had to run the script again to rename the images if there was any error.
- It took almost 5-6 minutes for full generation of images
- We discovered that we can rename all images in Mac but not in windows.
- We found out a [software](https://www.bulkrenameutility.co.uk/Main_Intro.php)- which helped us rename , add suffix/prefix and replace names of files in bulk, which increased our productivity by 10 times
- Now, as we were doing good with white background and black shaded objects, we decided to add a creative edge to our work by creating [environment](https://github.com/nikunjlad/3D-Object-Classification-Using-Capsule-Networks/blob/smit/Maya3D-Images-Dataset/Smit/Black_Environment.mb) which helped us to generate white-shaded images in black background.
- We also created limited objects without shadows as well.

- Also , We created image dataset with real colored or textured objects.

- We came up with naming convention such that by looking at it, one can know catergory, sub-category, angles, shaders and backgrounds.

## Conclusion
We have developed this database for Data science who are working on Object Recogition using Neural Nets.
Anyone who wants to use it can use it to develop their own database.
We would really appreaciate your feedback and support .
We are planning to continue our work in future as well.
