# 3D-Object-Classification-Using-Capsule-Networks
## My contribution in short

### Week 1
- Explored Maya and learnt its functionality
- Built basic objects like cubes, cones , etc
- Rotated them using python scripting
- Created camera and lights to get understanding of how shadows work
- Tried to manually capture images from camera view on single axis

### Week 2
- Started to work on the developing the scripts
- Worked on understanding the scripts developed by other teammates
- Fine tuned the parameters of "[Snapshot Script](https://github.com/nikunjlad/3D-Object-Classification-Using-Capsule-Networks/blob/smit/Database/Snapshot_Script.py)" to get good quality images
- The problems we faced was quality of images and the noise that came with taking snapshots
- We figured it out that by getting render image- we can maintain the quality of images
