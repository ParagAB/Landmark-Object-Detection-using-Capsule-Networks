# 3D-Object-Classification-Using-Capsule-Networks
## My contribution in short

### Week 1
- Installed Maya on Day 1
- Explored Maya and learnt its functionality using tutorials given by Prof Nik Brown and Youtube.
- Built basic objects like cubes, cones , etc
- Rotated them using python scripting
- Created camera and lights to get understanding of how shadows work
- Tried to manually capture images from camera view on single axis

### Week 2
- Started to work on the developing the scripts
- Worked on understanding the scripts developed by other teammates
- Fine tuned the parameters of "[Snapshot Script](https://github.com/nikunjlad/3D-Object-Classification-Using-Capsule-Networks/blob/smit/Maya3D-Images-Dataset/Smit/Snapshot_Script.py)" to get good quality images
- The problems we faced was quality of images and the noise that came with taking snapshots
- We figured it out that by getting render image- we can maintain the quality of images.
- The image we obtained looked like following:

### Week 3
- We needed shadows - so , we had to create a new [environment](https://github.com/nikunjlad/3D-Object-Classification-Using-Capsule-Networks/blob/smit/Maya3D-Images-Dataset/Smit/BestScene.mb).
- The above environment consists of a camera, lights, plane and final [script](https://github.com/nikunjlad/3D-Object-Classification-Using-Capsule-Networks/blob/smit/Maya3D-Images-Dataset/Smit/Final_Script.py)
- While few of us were working on improving the environment and finalizing the best script , I was collecting the objects
- Collecting objects seems like downloading stuff from internet, but it isn't as easy as it looks; takes too much time to get relevant objects.
- I managed to collect 42 objects and developed major categories of electronics and food.

### Week 4
- The object which were collected came in all shapes,colors and sizes - which were exactly not suitable to our environment
- I developed a practice of importing the objects, merging all the meshes , rescaling , applying shaders and making them point towards the person on laptop before actually importing it to our environment.

- Optimizing it before actually getting to run script on it consumed much time
- Images after optimization looked like:
