#MAYA

Firstly, i went through the videos and references provided by professor to get basic knowledge on how to get started with Maya. I have tried creating some basic scripts to take screen shots of images in MAYA to get familiar with the environment.

After that, i have modeled 10 objects of "Character" category end to end using the script that was created by the team with shadows. Below is the link with the images generated.

#Database

In database part, we came up with the conceptual database schema and created a physical database on mysql workbench. Later there are few modifications that are added to the schema based on the website requirement. Created new physical database based on the changes and inserted the sample data to configure it with cloud.


#Portfolio

Created portfolio to show the details of overall project.
